# SPI
This project involves the design, verification, and implementation of the SPI protocol using Verilog and SystemVerilog. The design will be developed in AMD Vivado with 5.5MHz clock frequency between master and slave and 9-bit data frame. Verification will be conducted in Mentor Graphics QuestaSim, utilizing SystemVerilog to ensure thorough coverage and reliability. The design will then be synthesized, implemented, and tested on a Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board to validate real-world performance. The project provides a complete flow from HDL design and verification to FPGA deployment, ensuring protocol functionality and robustness.
